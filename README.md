            PRIMARY KEY (emp_no)
        );

## B- Query

    1- List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee:
    
            SELECT e.emp_no, e.last_name, e.first_name, e.sex, s.salary
            FROM employees e
            JOIN salaries s ON e.emp_no = s.emp_no;

    2- List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986:

            SELECT first_name, last_name, hire_date
            FROM employees
            WHERE hire_date BETWEEN '1986-01-01' AND '1986-12-31';

    3- List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name:

            SELECT dm.dept_no, d.dept_name, dm.emp_no, e.last_name, e.first_name
            FROM dept_manager dm
            JOIN employees e ON dm.emp_no = e.emp_no
            JOIN departments d ON dm.dept_no = d.dept_no;
     
    4- List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name:

            SELECT de.dept_no, de.emp_no, e.last_name, e.first_name, d.dept_name
            FROM dept_emp de
            JOIN employees e ON de.emp_no = e.emp_no
            JOIN departments d ON de.dept_no = d.dept_no;
    
    5- List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B:

            SELECT first_name, last_name, sex
            FROM employees
            WHERE first_name = 'Hercules' AND last_name LIKE 'B%';
    
    6- List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name:

            SELECT e.emp_no, e.last_name, e.first_name
            FROM dept_emp de
            JOIN employees e ON de.emp_no = e.emp_no
            JOIN departments d ON de.dept_no = d.dept_no
            WHERE d.dept_name = 'Sales';
    
    7- List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name:

            SELECT e.emp_no, e.last_name, e.first_name, d.dept_name
            FROM dept_emp de
            JOIN employees e ON de.emp_no = e.emp_no
            JOIN departments d ON de.dept_no = d.dept_no
            WHERE d.dept_name IN ('Sales', 'Development');
    
    8- List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name):

            SELECT last_name, COUNT(*) as frequency
            FROM employees
            GROUP BY last_name
            ORDER BY frequency DESC;



## C- Usage

   1. Create Tables: Execute the CREATE TABLE statements to set up the database schema.
    
   2.Insert Data: Insert relevant data into the tables as required.
    
   3.Run Queries: Execute the provided SQL queries in the pgAdmin Query Tool to retrieve the specific information from the database.

   4.Modify as Needed: Adjust the queries to fit any specific requirements or different conditions as necessary.

   5.Analyze Results: Use the query results for analysis, reporting, or further data processing as needed.
